2. To Prevent Account Mark as Spam by Twitter.
    - Create new twitter account. With different username as one that already marked as spam. New freslhy one.
    - Don't follow to much in the start. Just follow 1 - 5, or max 10 accounts. Follow by doing searching on twitter search bar, not clicking follow from the mark as spammed account earlier.
    - Comment, like, repost, save for several times using this account by human (yourself), not bot.
    - Wait for couple of hours. 4 - 5 hours. Then try to run the bot. It can be using cookie or manual login.
    - If your twitter account is detected behaving suspicious from your primarly browser on your PC, then rective again by receiving the code sent to email.
